# Exercise 3

Objective
The objective of the Coin Toss Game is to accumulate a balance of exactly 100.0DA
by tossing different coins.

Game Rules:
• The game uses three types of coins: coin10, coin20, and coin50.
• Each coin has a specific value: coin10 worth DA10, coin20 worth DA20, and
coin50 worth DA50.
• At the beginning of the game, your balance is set to 0.
• During each round of the game, all three coins are tossed simultaneously.
• If a coin lands heads-up, its value is added to your balance. If it lands tails-up,
no change occurs.
• The game continues until your balance reaches or exceeds DA100.
• If your balance exactly equals DA100.0, you win the game.
• If your balance exceeds DA100.0, you lose the game.

Gameplay
• The game starts with a balance of DA0.0.
• The program will simulate the tossing of each coin (con10, coin20, and coin50) in every round.

• After each coin toss, the program will display the result: whether the coin landed heads-up or tails-up.
• If a coin lands heads-up, its value will be added to the balance, and the updated balance will be displayed.
• If the balance reaches or exceeds 100.0, the game ends. If the balance equals 100.0, a message will be displayed, indicating that you have won the game.
• If the balance exceeds 100.0, a message will be displayed, indicating that you have lost the game.

Note: The program uses dynamic casting and polymorphism to handle the different types of coins and their specific behaviors during the coin toss.

Enjoy playing the Coin Toss Game and try to accumulate exactly 100.0 balance to win... :) !
